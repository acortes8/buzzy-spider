#Buzzy Spider
A web scraper, and data parser, written in Ruby for my cocktail recipe web app. Uses Open-URI and Nokogiri to scrape cocktail recipes from an external website's sitemap. Then calls on a parser to extract and format the scraped ingredient section, so it fits the data models and format of the cocktail recipe web app. Writes to a JSON file to be used to seed the web app's database. Different repositories for easier management, these files will eventually be added to the main cocktail web app repository.
